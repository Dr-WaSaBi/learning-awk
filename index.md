# My awk-larning guild

For me, one of the best ways to learn something, is to try to teach it.  So here is me, trying to learn AWK.

## What is Awk

Awk is a test, or data processing programming langage created back in the mid to late 70's by some of the founders of the Unix operating system at Bell labs.  It's really good at processing a text file, line by line. Doing something with the data it finds on that line, and creating output of what it finds or sums up.

## How to run Awk

You can run Awk commands in one of two ways.  As what is called an Awk 1 Liner, or by creating a awk script file, with what you want the awk program to do inside of it.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Dr-WaSaBi/learning-awk/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
